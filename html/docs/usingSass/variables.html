  <h4>Using Sass Variables</h4>
  <p>Each component folder includes a file called #[code _variables.sass}. You can easily change the values of any major part of TARDIG, like grid size or the typographic scale. Because it is written modularly, each variables partial is sent to a global variables file, which makes the variables work across all files in the boilerplate while still keeping them well-organized.</p>
